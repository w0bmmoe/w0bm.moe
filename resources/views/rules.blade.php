        <h4>General Rules for w0bm.moe â€“ Only a troll would take anything posted here as a fact</h4>
</div>
<h5>General</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Content on this site is intended for people over the age of 18 only, if you are under 18 get the fuck out right now and don't tell your mom I didn't warn you!</li>
	<li>Leaking of private information is strictly forbidden.</li>
	<li>Do not talk about crimes you commited or will commit, we don't want to know.</li>
	<li>Do not try to sell, buy, or spread credit-card, banking etc. info anywhere on this site.</li>
	<li>Do not animate people to do crimes or anything illegal wherever the fuck you are!</li>
	<li>w0bm.moe is not a political and/or religious place, please refrain from going deep into the politics or religion topic. We have zero interest in these topics, they are always a problem and we don't want any problems internally we only want good videos. (And yes, good videos can contain politics and/or religion, it's all about the discussion culture here)</li>
	<li>If you upload something always try to give the artist credits by linking to the original, filling out the Artist & Songitle Information for example.</li>
	<li>Some videos may be offensive to some people, if you get easily offended please refrain from visiting w0bm.moe! We always have a open ear for your problems and we can talk about everything, there is nothing that is too edgy for us, we have seen it all and that's why we know how important it is to have a place for all kinds of videos and thoughts even if it triggers someone, please don't come back if you don't like what you see.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Uploading</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Everything you upload <strong style="color:#1FB2B0;">must</strong> be acceptable with Dutch law!</li>
	<li>Absolutely no child pornography in any way! This also includes "modeling" and 3D loli videos. 2D (hentai) is okay.</li>
	<li>Reposting is not a crime! But in most cases it can be prevented with the use of the <a href="https://w0bm.moe/index">search form</a>.
	<li>Put your uploads in the correct category, if you have a video that doesn't fit in any of the categories always put it in the Misc category</li.>
	<li>The focus is on videos you can easily watch 200 times a day over and over so upload only catchy shit! For example: <a href="/39">/39</a></li>
	<li>The Artist and Songtitle field is only for the Artist and Song information respectively, anything else in there probably doesn't belong in there, use the Tags.</li>
	<li>The Video Source field is not intended for YouTube Links or any other kind of link, please put only text in there. For example: YouTube and then put the YouTube link in the comments, if you fail at this too often it will probably hurt my vagina and I will scream like a 12 year old princess. Thanks! :3</li>

</ol>

<h5>Tagging</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Tags should always describe the video.</li>
	<li>No links in the Tags, use the comment section for that!</li>
	<li>Always give your video a rating like "sfw" or "nsfw" so people can filter.</li>
	<li>Please don't tag too much shit, thanks.</li>
	<li>Comments are not welcome in the Tag section, if we catch you say goodbye.</li>
</ol>
	
<h5>Commenting</h5>
<ol>
	<li>You don't have to be polite, but you also don't have to be an asshole.</li>
	<li>NSFW images should only be posted on NSFW videos.</li>
	<li>Live with different opinions, and deal with it.</li>
	<li>Fucking a mother is 2009-tier</li>
</ol>

<h5>Reposts</h5>
<ul style="text-align:left;">
<li>Tag reposts with the tag: repost also link the original and the repost in the comments, maybe some admin or moderator is going to care about it and deletes the repost.</li>
</ul>
