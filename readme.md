[w0bm.moe](https://w0bm.moe) is a fun modern website featuring many different kind of videos in webm format. It was initially thought as a [z0r.de](http://z0r.de) without flash, but already surpassed that in our opinion.

The page is build on top of the [Laravel Framework](https://laravel.com).

## Installing

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/w0bm/w0bm.moe.git`
2. Cd into the directory: `cd w0bm.moe`, run `./composer.phar dump-autoload` and `./composer.phar install --no-scripts` to install all the dependencies (make sure you have enough RAM for the installation, otherwise use swap)
3. Create a .env file inside of w0bm.moe/ with your database information ([Example](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/master/.env.example)) and set the `APP_KEY` with `php artisan key:generate` (it will automatically be added to the .env file if you already have `APP_KEY=` in there)
4. Create a b/ directory such that your path looks like this: `w0bm.moe/public/b`. Put at least 1 webm file in the `public/b` directory named `1.webm`
5. Modify `database/seeds/DatabaseSeeder.php` and uncomment all the different seeders. (Initially you'll need all)
6. Run `php artisan migrate` and then `php artisan db:seed`
7. Run `php artisan tags` to initially tag all videos
8. Start the development server with `php artisan serve`
9. Check your website at `http://localhost:8000/1`
10. Log in with Username=admin and Password=password
